                <p>
                    As a kid, I wanted to be a neurosurgeon, teacher, scientist at the same time. But, also, the brain,
                    as the most complex system, inspires me. So, I want to become an Artificial Intelligence Engineer.
                    Sounds funny, right? I think AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) goes through the intersection of
                    Natural Language Processing and Computer vision with lending some tricks from Reinforcement
                    Learning.</p>

                <p>My research focuses on applying Machine Learning methods to find insights into bacterial genes. </p>

                <p>I love to be better 1% at a time and be more productive every day. I have a taste for Philosophy and
                    Psychology, and Personal Development.</p>
