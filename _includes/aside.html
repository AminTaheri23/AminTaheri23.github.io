                <p>
                    Born in Ahwaz -> Moved to Tehran at the age of 14 -> NODET -> IAUCTB -> Moved to Karaj at the age of
                    21. As a kid, I wanted to be a neurosurgeon, teacher, scientist at the same time. I am inspired by
                    the brain, so I became an Artificial Intelligence Engineer. I think the way to AGI (Artificial
                    General Intelligence) goes through <b>NLP</b> and <b>RL</b>. I love to be better 1% at a time and be more
                    productive every day. I have a taste for Philosophy and Psychology and Personal Development.
